# Machine Learning Journey

This repository documents my process of learning Machine Learning step by step.  
Each notebook focuses on one concept, from basic data preprocessing to model building and evaluation.
The goal is to understand ML concepts step-by-step, from basic data handling to building models using `scikit-learn`.
